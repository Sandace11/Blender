All you need to do to start is to run mineways.exe (or mineways32.exe on 32-bit computers). Stuck? Errors? See http://mineways.com/downloads.html

Open docs/index.html or visit http://mineways.com for documentation links, credits, etc.

See http://mineways.com/reference.html#mf for an explanation of what each file is about.

There are different major versions of Mineways. You usually want the latest version; the ancient version 1.15 of Mineways can be used on older worlds, but it's better to simply load older worlds into Minecraft and have it convert to the latest format.

For historical purposes:
Version 6.* works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.13 and beyond, but is 64-bit only.
Version 5.* works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.9 and beyond, adds scripting language.
Version 4.* works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.9 and beyond, 64-bit for large exports.
Version 3.* works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.7 worlds (Anvil, stair geometry changes, and new texturing).
Version 2.* works on Minecraft 1.2 to 1.4 worlds (Anvil format).
Version 1.* works on Minecraft 1.1 worlds and earlier (McRegion format).

Much of the original interface and file read code is from Minutor, http://seancode.com/minutor/ - all hail Sean Kasun!
