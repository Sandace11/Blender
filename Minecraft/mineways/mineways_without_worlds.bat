@rem Run Mineways in a way to avoid loading any worlds stored on your machine.
@rem Use this .bat file if Mineways "hangs" when you start it.
@rem All this script does is gives a directory that exists but (probably) is not where your worlds are stored,
@rem so that none are loaded.
mineways.exe -s none
