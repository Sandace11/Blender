This directory contains a bunch of scripts, Python 3 files, and batch files as examples of automating various Mineways functions. Some can be run as-is, others need to be edited first in order to load your world.

Open a file in a text editor to read what it does, and modify it as you wish. Note:
  *.mwscript - a Mineways scripting file, executed by using "File | Import Settings" in Mineways
  *.bat - a Windows batch file, a set of commands to run Mineways or other programs
  *.py - a Python 3 script, usually for generating a Mineways script or Windows batch file

See http://mineways.com/scripting.html for documentation of scripting commands.
