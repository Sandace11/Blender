# Simple Python script to output adjacent hunks of a world.
# Version 1.0, Eric Haines, erich@acm.org
#
# Running this generates a .mwscript file that can be read into Mineways to export
# a series of "hunks" from a world. Usually worlds are too large - too much memory -
# to export in one giant OBJ file. This script lets you choose how large each hunk is.
# These hunks use "absolute coordinates" (not centered), so that they can be loaded one
# after the other next to each other in programs such as Blender.
#
# Process:
# Install Python, then edit this file to change the arguments at the top of this file
# to whatever area in your world you want to export and run it in a command window:
#    python hunk_maker.py > hunks.mwscript
#
# This creates a file called "hunks.mwscript". In Mineways you then load your world,
# optionally set your terrain file, and then choose File | Import Settings and select
# this hunks.mwscript file. The script will then run and export a bunch of OBJ and MTL
# files where you specified, along with block textures in the "texture" directory.

# What to put for the output file. Forward slashes are preferred; note that if you use
# backslashes, they have to be "doubled": 'c:\\temp\\hunk'
file = 'c:/temp/hunk'

# Starting location. Note that in Mineways you can see map coordinates for your mouse
# in the lower left corner of the screen, e.g. "-29,311"
xstart = -200
zstart = -200

# Ending location
xend = 200
zend = 200

# How big is a hunk? For example, '100' means exporting 100x100. You can certainly go much larger,
# depending on your machine's memory capabilities.
sz = 100

# Y height extents. You may want to change these; 0-255 is the maximum, but people
# often don't want all the underground blocks, so a ystart = 50 is usually fine (62 is "sea level")
# For 1.17 the valid range is -64 to 319
ystart = 0
yend = 255

print("Set render type: Wavefront OBJ absolute indices");
print("File type: Export tiles for textures to directory texture");
print("Center model: NO");
print("Create block faces at the borders: NO");

            ' to ' + str(x+sz-1) + ', ' + str(yend) + ', ' + str(z+sz-1)
        print (s)
